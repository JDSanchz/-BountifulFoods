            <p>Bountiful Foods was founded in 2023, shortly after the attacks of alien California residents. The Carson family, who had been farmers for generations, saw an opportunity to provide fresh and healthy food options to the affected community. They worked tirelessly to source locally grown produce, and started selling fruit and vegetable bags out of the trunk of their almost destroyed car.</p>
            <p>As the population started growing demand for their products grew as well, the Carsons opened a small storefront in Carlsbad, and eventually expanded to a fleet of alien-enhanced food trucks that covered the coastal area from Los Angeles to San Diego. Today, Bountiful Foods continues to prioritize working with local farmers and promoting healthy eating habits.</p>
            <p>The Carsons are proud to have built a successful business that supports the community and provides fresh, sustainable, and delicious food options to locals and tourists (aliens included) alike.</p>
